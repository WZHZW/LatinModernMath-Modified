# LatinModernMath-Modified 

[ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](/README_ZH.md)

This repository provides a **modified version** of the [Latin Modern Math](https://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/latin-modern) font, specifically aimed at solving an issue for users who want a LaTeX-like experience in Microsoft Word.

The original font was developed by **GUST e-foundry** and is released under the **GUST Font License (GFL)**.

## üéØ The Problem It Solves

While the standard *Latin Modern Math* font works perfectly in a LaTeX environment, its rendering of **double-struck capital letters** (e.g., `\mathbb{R}` for the set of real numbers ‚Ñù) in Microsoft Word's equation editor is often unsatisfactory. It does not produce the classic, clear "blackboard bold" style that users of LaTeX (with packages like `amssymb`) are accustomed to.

**This modified font fixes that.** It ensures that double-struck characters in Word's equation editor appear just as they would in a professional LaTeX document.

## üîß Modifications

Compared to the official *Latin Modern Math* font, this version includes one key change:

- **Enhanced Double-Struck Glyphs**: The glyphs for **double-struck capitals (`\mathbb{}`)** have been replaced with a visually superior, MSBM-style version, ensuring a consistent and professional look in both LaTeX and Microsoft Word.
- **Minor Adjustments**: Other small adjustments have been made to improve compatibility in mathematical typesetting.

All other glyphs and font features remain identical to the original version.
